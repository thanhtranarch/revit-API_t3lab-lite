# ABOUT

Hi, this is **T3Lab Space** - where I share BIM workflows, Revit resources, and design insights from working on architectural projects. This space is dedicated to exploring how technology can improve the way we design and build, making complex processes more efficient and accessible.

Through years of working with BIM and computational design tools, I've learned that the best solutions come from combining technical knowledge with practical experience. Here, I share what works in real-world projects.

## What I work with

- **Revit** - BIM modeling and documentation
- **Python** - Custom tools and scripts

## What you'll find here

- Practical BIM workflows from real projects
- Custom Revit families and resources
- Tips and tutorials for architects and BIM users
- Computational design experiments
- Documentation and best practices from professional experience
